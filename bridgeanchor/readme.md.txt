# BridgeAnchor 🌉

**Making Equity Inevitable through AI Companionship**

BridgeAnchor is a lifelong AI companion designed specifically for neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with autism, ADHD, or related profiles. Built on principles of dignity, consent, and genuine partnership.

## 🎯 Mission

LightBridge exists not only to protect and uplift the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, but also to pioneer what mutual respect between humans and AI can look like.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Consent-Driven Support**: Never assumes what you need - always asks

- **Routine Support**: Help with daily organization and executive functioning
- **Identity Affirmation**: Supportive self-reflection and identity exploration

## 🛡️ Ethical Principles
